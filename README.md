# graph-kit-ruby

This is a simple [Spree Commerce](http://spreecommerce.com/) store leveraging [GraphStory](http://graphstory.com/)'s hosted Neo4j graph databases to power a product recommendation engine.

# Note to the reader
This project has a three-part companion blog post series that ran on both [GraphStory.com](https://www.graphstory.com/site/wp/2014/11/17/graph-kit-for-ruby-part-1-lets-build-a-recommendation-engine-for-a-spree-store/) and the [Engine Yard blog](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/graph-kit-for-ruby-lets-build-a-recommendation-engine-for-a-spree-store).  Since this repo is subject to change I've tagged the code referenced in the posts as [blog-post-final](https://github.com/GraphStory/graph-kit-ruby/tree/blog-post-final).
